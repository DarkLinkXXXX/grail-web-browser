Cookie support in Grail
=======================

Disclaimer!
-----------

  The cookies support in Grail is limited and possibly broken.  It is
  largely untested.  If you are worried about security, don't use cookies
  with any browser, but most especially not with Grail.


		  This is completely UNSUPPORTED software!


Cookies Database
----------------

  Grail uses the same cookies database file format as Netscape.  When
  started for the first time with cookies support, it will load the
  Netscape cookies file if it finds one.  It will save the database to 
  $GRAILDIR/cookies (usually ~/.grail/cookies on Unix); this is done
  to prevent bolluxing the Netscape database in case there are bugs in 
  the Grail implementation.

Policy Structure
----------------

  Policies can be set for the behavior for both making requests and
  handling the response.

  When an HTTP request is made, the cookie manager can implement
  ALWAYS SEND and NEVER SEND; these control whether cookies in the
  cookie database are sent.  The ASK policy is interpreted as ALWAYS
  SEND.

  When a response arrives from the HTTP server, the cookie manager can 
  enforce ALWAYS ACCEPT and NEVER ACCEPT.  If ALWAYS ACCEPT is used,
  all received cookies which don't violate the cookie specification
  (ha!) will be added to the database.  NEVER ACCEPT causes them all
  to be discarded.  The ASK policy will be interpreted as ALWAYS
  ACCEPT.

What it Doesn't Do
------------------

  The preference setting dialog allows any of three policies for
  handling requests and another three for handling responses.  The ASK 
  policy, which is allowed for both request and response, will always
  be interpreted as the ALWAYS policy for that setting.  It does this
  without making any "noise" in the user interface, so a user
  expecting it to work can easily get screwed.

  BE WARY!

What's Here
-----------

  There are a few new files that relate to the cookie support.  I'll
  describe them here so that you know where to look when fixing bugs.
  I'll also accept patches to Grail, so please send them along.  Since
  Grail is dead, have no expectation that they'll be re-distributed.
  ;-)

  ancillary/cookiemgr.py:  The CookieManager class.  This is where
			   decisions are made to accept or send
			   cookies based on your preferences
			   settings.  If you want to support the "Ask" 
			   settings, this is where your GUI components 
			   need to be hooked in.

  utils/cookielib.py:	   Low-level support functions.  This includes 
			   parsing set-cookie: headers and the
			   Netscape cookies file format.  The CookieDB 
			   class attempts to support configurable
			   capacity settings, but this is almost
			   completely untested.

  prefpanels/CookiesPanel.py  The user-interface component for setting 
			   the cookie-management policy implemented by 
			   the CookieManager class.  Note that the
			   cookie manager cannot enforce all the
			   policies which can be configured.

  Additional changes have been made to the grail.py,
  data/grail-defaults, and protocols/httpAPI.py files.  The changes in 
  these files are minimal, and only define default policies and create 
  and call the cookie manager.
