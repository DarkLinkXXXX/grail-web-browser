GRAIL README
------------

This is an experimental binary distribution of GRAIL, an web browser
written and extensible using Python.  Once you have untarred the
distribution you should have the following files and directory:

README		this file
grail.sh	shell script to start the browser
grail.bin	the browser binary
tksupp/		directory with tcl/tk support scripts

The binary is specific to a platform; which platform depends on the
file which you have downloaded.  Supported platforms are SGI IRIX 5.3
and Solaris 2.4 (IRIX 5.2 and Solaris 2.3 should also be able to run
these binaries).

To start the grail browser, run the grail.sh script, e.g.

	./grail.sh

The browser will display information about itself which is at the
following URL:
